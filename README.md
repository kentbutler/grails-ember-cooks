### Sample webapp integrating EmberJS and Grails

This is a sample app which integrates EmberJS with a Grails REST service. Uses Bootstrap for layout and widgeting, with a theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).

The Grails app uses a modified [grails-json-rest-api](https://github.com/kentbutler/grails-json-rest-api) for REST servicing.


#### Quickstart

* Install [Grails 2.1.1](http://grails.org/) 

* Download this app

        git clone https://github.com/kentbutler/grails-ember-cooks.git

* Download the fork of the grails-json-rest-api 

        git clone https://github.com/kentbutler/grails-json-rest-api.git

* Place them alongside each other and run by opening a console inside the grails-ember-cooks directory and execute:

        grails run-app 

* Navigate to http://localhost:8080/cook/
